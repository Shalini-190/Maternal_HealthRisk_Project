# 🏥 Maternal Health Risk Prediction

This project predicts **maternal health risk levels** using **Hierarchical Clustering & Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**.  
Users can enter health details like **Age, Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, Body Temperature, and Heart Rate**,  
and the model classifies them into **Low, Moderate, or High Risk** categories.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**
- ✅ **Applies ML clustering algorithms** (Agglomerative Clustering & GMM) to predict **maternal health risk**.
- ✅ **Uses PCA for visualization** to show how patients are grouped.
- ✅ **Provides personalized health recommendations** based on the predicted risk level.
- ✅ **Generates a CSV file with results** for further analysis.
